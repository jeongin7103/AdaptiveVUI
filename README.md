User-adaptive VUI: Multimodal signal based emotion recognition

This repository supports actual implementation of user-adaptive VUI which is equipped with keyword spotting system and emotion recognition engine. 
By utilizing facial and EEG data, we developed facial expression based emotion recognition (FER) model and EEG-based emotion recognition (EER) model.
FER model is developed using DAN (distract your attention) network, while EER model is developed using ShallowNet architecture.
